# Book Review App

## Overview

**Book Review App** is a modern, full-stack **three-tier web application** that allows users to browse books, read reviews, and submit their own. It demonstrates clean separation of concerns between frontend and backend, and is ideal for hands-on DevOps and cloud deployment practices.

- **Unauthenticated users** can view book details and existing reviews.
- **Authenticated users** can register, log in, and submit reviews.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Built using **Next.js**, providing server-side rendering and dynamic routing.
- **Backend**: Powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, handling authentication, book data, and reviews.
- **Database**: Uses **MySQL** with Sequelize ORM.
  
This three-tier architecture can be independently deployed, making it ideal for containerization, cloud hosting, and CI/CD implementation.
